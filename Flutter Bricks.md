## **5. Advanced Customization**

### **5.1. Global Theme Integration**
Integrate Flutter Bricks with your app’s theme to ensure consistent styling across components:
```dart
ThemeData theme = ThemeData(

  textTheme: TextTheme(
    bodyText1: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
  ),
);

MaterialApp(
  theme: theme,
  home: MyHomePage(),
);
```

### **5.2. Component-Level Customization**
Override specific properties to customize individual widgets:
```dart
BricksButton(
  text: "Custom Styled Button",
  onPressed: () {},
  color: Colors.orange,
  borderRadius: 12.0,
  elevation: 5,
)
```

### **5.3. Customizing Cards**
```dart
BricksCard(
  title: "Custom Card",
  subtitle: "With a unique style",
  backgroundColor: Colors.blueGrey,
  content: Column(
    children: [
      Icon(Icons.star, color: Colors.yellow),
      Text("Customizable Content"),
    ],
  ),
)
```
